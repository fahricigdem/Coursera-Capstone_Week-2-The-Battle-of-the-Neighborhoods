# Finding-out-the-Cities-of-Niedersachsen-Coursera-Capstone-

- In this project we will try to find optimal locations for the investments.
Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening
stores in Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony), Germany.
 We are also particularly interested in rural areas. We would also prefer
locations with middle level population.
 We will use our data science powers to generate more information about
promising cities based on these criteria. Advantages of each area will then be
clearly expressed.
